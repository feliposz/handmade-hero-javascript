# Handmade Hero - Javascript

An incomplete implementation of [Casey Muratori](http://mollyrocket.com/casey/about.html)'s [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) in pure javascript.

This was basically a review of the first 30+ episodes.

I keep [another repository](https://github.com/feliposz/handmade-hero/) with my progress on the main series.
